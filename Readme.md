## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Get Your Cookies File

The script requires a `cookies.json` file from your logged-in Facebook session to avoid manual authentication.

1.  Install a browser extension like **"EditThisCookie"** (for Chrome or Firefox).
2.  Log in to Facebook in your browser.
3.  Go to `facebook.com`, click the extension icon, and export the cookies in JSON format.
4.  Save this JSON file as `www.facebook.com.cookies.json` in the same directory as your `gui.py` script.

### Step 2: Run the Application

Once all requirements are installed, you can run the GUI application:

```bash
python gui.py
```

### Step 3: Configure and Start

1.  The GUI application window will appear. Make sure the `Cookies File` and `Output File` paths are correct.
2.  Adjust other options like `Headless Mode`, `Scroll Delay`, and `Max Scroll Attempts` to fit your needs.
3.  Click the **"Start Scraping"** button to begin the process.
4.  You can view the logs and the status of the process in the application window.
5.  To stop the process at any time, click the **"Stop Scraping"** button.

### Output

After the process is complete (or interrupted), the script will generate three files in the output directory you specified:

1.  `your_filename.csv` - The raw CSV file containing all the extracted groups, including the unfiltered ones.
2.  `your_filename_names_filtered.txt` - A text file with the filtered group names.
3.  `your_filename_urls_filtered.txt` - A text file with the filtered group URLs.
